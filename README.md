# ML-Algorithms
A part of my practice include:
  Implement KNN algorithm for classification.

  Implement simple linear regression.

  Implement logistic regression.

  Design non-linear model using support vector machines.

  Implement k-means clustering algorithm.

  Implement random forest ensemble method.

  Build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) by implementing the back propagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate dataset.
